# Anvil Coding Takehome
Hello ðŸ‘‹ & welcome to the anvil coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems, not for us to test magic keyword knowledge of our tech stack. If you're having build issues ðŸ”§ with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## How it works

* You will get an email from one of us with the specific task to complete
* Fork this repo into your own account
* Make a new branch
* When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
* We will take a look at your solution, then talk through your solution during your interview
